# this config forwards (transparently) redirected (to port 8011) plaintext HTTP requests via the parent plaintext HTTP upstream proxy to the target host (as specified in the http request itself)
# For transparently redirected requests it transforms the target after the GET into absolute form before forwarding it to the parent proxy
# the port 8011 can be also used as http proxy without transparent redirection than it adds proxy auth credentials to the request as specied in the parent config line
